<div class="bulk"><div class="poem">
    <p>Getting to school early has its downfalls. For one, I have to wake up early: that’s usually not too fun. I tend to enjoy the later hours more than the early ones, though there’s something about how the bolts of adrenaline run through your veins from waking up at an ungodly hour that adds something exciting to an otherwise dreadful routine. Perhaps it’s like an addiction, but one I can certainly survive without. But because I’m forced to get to school early, I’m also forced to stay in some random room &mdash; this year it’s the auditorium &mdash; and I can see everybody walk in. Each person is walking in for the first time today, but I’ve already seen dozens of faces. I guess there aren't any faces anymore but pairs of eyes, but eyes can tell you so much. The same situation, approached by different sets of eyes: some tired, some searching for friends, some still a bit confused, some down to the floor, some completely apathetic and empty. Their eyes capture the world in different ways than I do, the same way the same(?) color blue can be someone’s favorite or least favorite color. I don’t really have a favorite color by the way, I find that there are some good and bad things in each. My favorite color used to be red &mdash; when I felt a need to define myself by what I liked and didn’t like about the world &mdash; but that didn’t mean I didn’t find the other colors nice. I’m getting off topic. It’s like I’m God: I already have this knowledge of the situation while all the people I observe are discovering it for the first time. Even though it’s the exact same auditorium as yesterday, they’re discovering it with new eyes, maybe slightly blurred from their sleep, or sharpened from a walk they took yesterday. I’m not the only God, but everyone else has their eyes locked on the glow of their laptops, which, frankly, I should be doing too. I’m curious what my expression is when I walk in, and how it fits into the gray mush of the masses. This is a poem I guess, that’s the closest thing to whatever this is, but the lack of linebreaks kind of sets it out of that category.
    <br> I hate linebreaks, they are so fucking pretentious.
