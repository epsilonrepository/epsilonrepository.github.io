	<p>Hunger comes in many different forms, not just in the physical. There is physical hunger, the longing for food, but also water or sleep; mental hunger, the longing for knowledge and experience; emotional hunger, the longing for stability and connections with others. Richard Wright, an infamous African American writer, has experienced all of these, and documents his experience through his writing. In <i>Black Boy</i> by Richard Wright, hunger and its variations are utilized as a motif that, through years of hardship, builds Wright into the successful author and activist we learn about today, and helps communicate the struggles of living in a poor black household in the early 20th century.</p>
	<p>First, Wright's mental and emotional starvation turned him into a rebellious and radical thinker. As shown in the passage, Wright was extremely isolated and reserved at school around his peers. Wright details: “I was reserved with the boys and girls at school, seeking their company but never letting them guess how much I was being kept out of the world in which they lived, valuing their casual friendships but hiding it, acutely self-conscious but covering it with a quick smile and ready phrase” (Wright 162). This passage shows how Wright was somewhat devoid of real connections with people, and how he was very introspective about his situation. This doesn't show how he was naturally very outspoken, despite what some think, but shows how Wright put on a persona to protect himself. Sometimes, this persona interfered with his education. But his isolation left him with a lot of time to think and come up with ideas. To challenge the system, like with his disdain of religion, adoption of a Communist political identity, and even the themes of his writing. Wright's hunger, his lack of true emotional connections and lack of a lengthy and stable formal education, allowed him to become a revolutionary voice of his time. </p>
	<p>Secondly, his physical hunger helps communicate the struggles of being in a poor African-American household growing up. It's important to remember why Wright is literally starving, and that's because of his family. Wright has given a dilemma by his family, particularly his Granny, and he chose education and experiences over food. He explains: “Had I gone home to eat my plate of greens, Granny would not have allowed me out again, so the penalty I paid for roaming was to forfeit my food for twelve hours” (Wright 162). This is a foreign concept for many people, especially today. The overarching message of <i>Black Boy</i> is that there is a great difference between white, upper and middle class households, and black, lower class households, and their opportunities. And starvation, making Richard so weak that it “would make [him] sway while walking” (Wright 163) displays this perfectly. Wright's hunger, his lack of a stable food source, allowed <i>Black Boy</i> to give a clear, concise, and arguably effective message about households like his. </p>
	<p>In <i>Black Boy</i> by Richard Wright, the motif of hunger builds Wright into a radical thinker and we learn about today, and helps communicate the struggles of living in a poor African-American household. What is hunger? Hunger could be described as the lack of a critical human need. Wright is an extremely influential man who grew up to live a thrilling life, and it helps to look to his background to see how he achieved his success. Sometimes, in order to live a full life, it takes a little hunger along the way.</p>

<h3>Note from August 2024</h3>
<p>The conclusion where I say "Sometimes, in order to live a full life, it takes a little hunger along the way" is actually crazy. I do not know what I was thinking; my only guess was that I had a few seconds to think of a last sentence before my time ran out. Please do not think that I believe that Wright's hunger was in any way necessary or justifiable.</p>
