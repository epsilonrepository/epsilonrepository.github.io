    <p>Welcome to Bapple Blog, the worst blog ever. This is mainly just gonna be my dumping ground for any miscellaneous things that I want to write or have written. It will be shit. I do not expect anyone to read it. It will exist despite this.</p>
    <p>Let me introduce myself: My name is Edward. I'm scared of sharing my name but I'm doing it anyway. I'm a college student at the moment. I like writing about politics, music theory, student rights, and some other random crap too. I like the Oxford comma. I like to think of myself as a good person but that's up to interpretation.</p>
    <p>I'm a leftist, maybe a Marxist. I say "maybe" because aligning myself to Marx means I have to defend him. I was a moderate when I was 12 and a progressive when I was 16. When I was 14, I called myself "in between a moderate and a progressive" because I was stupid. I'm 18 now. I'm a firm believer in democracy and that's the core principle that tends to determine my beliefs.</p>
    <p>I christened myself "Bapple Business" when I was 11 and wanted to start a YouTube channel. It was going to be the name of a music duo that I started with my friend two years prior. We had created a YouTube channel that we never used, and I needed a psuedonym, so "Bapple Business" it was. There's a longer story there but I'll leave that for later.</p>
    <p>I'm writing because I like to write. I haven't written in a while because I'm busy. I'm gonna try to write now. The fun thing about writing is that you can write the shittiest things and, if you call it art, people will like it (or at least pretend to). This makes me feel good.</p>
