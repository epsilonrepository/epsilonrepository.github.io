    <h3>What is one accomplishment or goal you have for 2019? Why? Explain.</h3>
    <p>I typically don't set resolutions for a new year because I tend not to meet them, making me depressed and disappointed with myself. Although not trying at all would be kind of pathetic, so that's why I have a few unspoken goals. One goal I have is to try and find a school-life balance, like how many adults strive for a work-life balance, to find an equilibrium between doing things I want to do and need to do. Sometimes I convince myself that it's impossible, but I'm going to try to achieve it this year. As my life has progressed, I feel more and more like I'm not doing enough on both ends of the scale. Feeding into that feeling too much can potentially be unhealthy, but finding a balance is the key. </p>
