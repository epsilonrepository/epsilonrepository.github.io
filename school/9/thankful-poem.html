<div class="bulk"><div class="poem">
    <p>You were the plank I held on to while the water was rising<br>
        The harness I needed to scale the cliff I'm climbing<br>
        The foundation I used to build a village<br>
        Man, I'm way too privileged</p>
    <p>You're my guide who helped me wander through the labyrinth<br>
        The one to defend me from the monsters who pillaged<br>
        Through my mind and heart and essence I knitted<br>
        And at the end I'm the only one that benefited</p>
    <p>And even though you've had your moments that you're livid<br>
        Saying that I'm the one that stays uncommitted<br>
        I recognize and sympathize with your situation<br>
        And I'll try to bring you to your own destination</p>
    <p>So now I just want to thank you for your forgiveness <br>
        For the times that the plague took advantage<br>
        For staying long enough that your essence you knitted<br>
        Was burned by all of the monsters who pillaged</p>
