        <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Hey kids! Do you want to learn about America?<br>
                <i>What's America?</i><br>
                Wow, you really are stupid. Okay, America is where we live! They make the laws we follow-<br>
                <i>What's a law?</i><br>
                Don't interrupt me again, child. Laws are basically adult rules, but you have to follow them too. Now, there are 50 states in America, sort of like mini countries. You want to hear some of them?<br>
                <i>Yeah!</i></p>
        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <p>New York, Texas, California,<br>
                West Virginia, and Georgia<br>
                These are states, yes, we agree<br>
                And they are all special to me<br>
                Alabama, Minnesota,<br>
                Hawaii there off the shore<br>
                These are states that we adore<br>
                But nobody likes Florida</p>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>Florida is full of potheads<br>
                And criminals with malintent<br>
                When people say they go to Florida<br>
                It's these things they forget</p>
        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <p>Massachusetts, Mississippi,<br>
                Ohio and Washington state<br>
                These are states that are okay<br>
                They have names I want to say <br>
                Delaware, the Carolinas<br>
                New Jersey and the Dakotas<br>
                These are states that we don't mind<br>
                But nobody likes Florida</p>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>Florida is full of dumbfucks<br>
                And wackos on the streets<br>
                When people say they go to Florida<br>
                Remember your beliefs</p>            
        <h3>Intermission</h3>
            <p><i>But my grandma used to live in Florida!</i><br>
                She probably was a wacko too.<br>
                <i>Everyone in Florida can't be a wacko, right?</i><br>
                Wrong. Everyone who is in Florida willingly has something wrong in their soul.</p>            
        <h3>Bridge</h3>
            <p>Is it a coincidence<br>
                That Florida's full of incidents<br>
                Like *speaking* “Florida Man Tries to Shoot Puppy, Puppy Shoots Him Instead”<br>
                */* Or *speaking* “Florida Man Gets Beat up by the Easter Bunny” */*<br>
                What the fuck is happening?<br>
                What the fuck is happening?</p>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>Florida is just a hellhole<br>
                Loads of monstrosities<br>
                When you look at Florida<br>
                There's one conclusion to see…<br>
                Nobody likes Florida</p>
