        <p>If you think this blog is going to be the best blog in the history of the universe, you're wrong. In fact, I just learned that blogs still existed a few days ago when I started making this website. So, I'm not an expert in making blogs. But I will be posting here every so often.</p>
        <p>It will mostly be either ideas for videos that didn't make the cut, or ideas I will be making into videos soon. I don't expect anyone to check on this regularly, except maybe Ottis Plays or Turtwig Gaming. But I'm not even sure about them. </p>
        <p>The main reason why I have a blog on here is because this website needs to be more than just my newest three videos and a way to contact me. I want to have a second page on my website, and even if no one looks at it, it should be there just for looks. </p>
        <p>Making a blog would also be a great (and actually fun) way of creating scripts for my videos. Some of my videos will likely just be reading off the blog, so that way I can have two videos a week like I used to have (before I broke my wrist). </p>
        <p>That's all I have for right now. So if you think this blog is going to be the best blog in the history of the universe, you're wrong. It's just going to be slightly worse than mediocre. </p>
