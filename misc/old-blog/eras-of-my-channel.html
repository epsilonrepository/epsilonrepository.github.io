        <h2>Eras of My Channel</h2>
        <h4>September 30, 2017</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="bulk">
            <p>I have had my YouTube channel for over 3 years now, and looking back, I've realized that my channel can be neatly organized into eras, like history. If you didn't already know, I love making categories of things, like Generations, so if I can organize the history of my own YouTube channel I will. Let's start.</p>
        <h3>The Prevideo Era</h3>
            <p>My journey begins August 16, 2014, when I create my YouTube channel. This wasn't for myself, it was for a "band" called Bapple Business. We couldn't come up with a better name, even though there are lots that I can think of. Like Bapple Boys, Bapple Blues, or even just Bapple Band. Anyway, around one to two months later, the band broke up, and I was stuck with the YouTube channel.</p>
            <p>Actually, I did upload videos to the YouTube channel, but I deleted them in a rage that I regret to this day (Ottis and Turtwig would know what I'm talking about). So for over a year, I didn't do anything with my channel.</p>
            <p>But I did help with my friend Colin's channel. I set up his channel, CJFilms, and edited his first video, Top 5 Ways To Die in Minecraft. There was one problem though, it really sounded like he said n****r. I had to take down the video, reedit it, and upload it again. He later changed his channel name to BlaCkLighTning and delete all of his previous videos, including the one I edited for him, but that's okay. </p>
            <p>Wait! Don't leave! I am talking about eras, don't worry. This first era, from August 14, 2014 to October 9, 2015, is called the Prevideo Era. I uploaded no videos (besides the ones I just talked about) in this time period. But this would soon change. </p>
        <h3>The Gaming Era</h3>
            <p>On October 10, 2015, I uploaded Bapple Business Trailer, my big return to the YouTube scene! I had been recording videos for weeks, just to make this one video, this one trailer, to show what my channel was going to be. Ironically, only one of the planned videos shown in the trailer actually became a video. Not a great trailer, I guess.</p>
            <p>From October 10, 2015 to December 10, 2016, I uploaded mostly gaming videos. Because of this, this era is called the Gaming Era. I know, very creative name. This era makes up the majority of my video making, but I knew from early to mid 2016 that my gaming videos were going to stop eventually. My comedy videos simply just got more views. Even though the gaming videos were much easier to make, I was much prouder of the comedy videos.</p>
        <h3>The Comedy Era</h3>
            <p>On December 11, 2016, I uploaded Super Basketball to my channel, and after seeing how much support it got, I realized the time to switch was now. December 11, 2016 marked the beginning of the Comedy Era.</p>
            <p>The border between the Gaming Era and the Comedy Era is very blurry. I put it at the later date, but the Gaming Era could have ended when I released SACKMAN, making the Gaming Era a measly 2 months. I also could have ended it when I made my last gaming video, ROCKET LEAGUE FUNNY MOMENTS (with Ottis Plays), which was February 27, 2017. But that is far too late.</p> 
            <p>At the beginning of the Comedy Era, I realized my content would have to drastically improve for me not only to get views, but to feel proud about my videos. I continued making comedy videos, getting good views and slowly improving. But then, something completely unexpected happened. </p>
            <p>I had been working on making a song for 3 months. I showed it to my family, who said it was good, and then I released it to my friends on YouTube. I didn't realize how well the video would go. Breaking my like record in a couple hours, my original song Persist was a massive hit. I thought people would say it was okay, but people really liked it. I knew they did because of the like to dislike ratio. If people didn't like it, they could easily, anonymously, dislike my video. But they didn't. This was evidence that this was a beginning of a new era, the Music Era.</p> 
        <h3>The Music Era</h3>
            <p>The Music Era began April 28, 2017, but this didn't mean I would just make music. Here's my quote from Hope (An Original Song), "Now don't worry, I won't be making songs all the time. Maybe every five videos or so I'll upload a new one." I knew people would get sick of my songs, so if I had buffer, the appreciation for my music would be greater.</p> 
            <p>I want to make more serious videos, but I also want to make people smile. I want to make videos about math and education, but I also want to make music. I can't do everything, right? I have to choose something to focus on. Is music just something I happen to share on YouTube, or is it the future of my channel?</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>I'm not sure if this means the Comedy Era is over, they might even overlap, who knows! It's just too early to say. So here's the (incomplete) list of Bapple Business eras:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Prevideo Era: August 16, 2014 &ndash; October 9, 2015</li>
                <li>The Gaming Era: October 10, 2015 &ndash; December 10, 2016</li>
                <li>The Comedy Era: December 11, 2016 &ndash; April 28, 2017?</li>
                <li>The Music Era: April 28, 2017 &ndash; Present</li>
