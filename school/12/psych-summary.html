    <p>I chose to study the effect of surrounding beauty on test performance. I hypothesized that if a student’s surroundings include elements of beauty, then they would perform better on an academic test.</p> 
    <p>To avoid relying on subjectivity, I identified four components of beauty to vary in the two groups of the experiment: life, art, color, and order. Test performance should be largely independent from prior knowledge or classes, but variable based on external factors. I chose a relatively obscure but simple logic puzzle, a 4-by-4 KenKen puzzle, to act as the measure of test performance. The experiment was conducted in a conference room (room 119). This provided an isolated room with little outside noise and no prior mental associations. Subjects would be in one of two groups: the room decorated ugly or the room decorated beautifully. The data for the ugly room was collected during periods 2, 3, and 4, on Tuesday, May 17; data for the beautiful room was collected during periods 4 and 5 on Thursday, May 19. </p> 
    <p>Participants went through the experiment in pairs. The participants were first asked if they had any prior knowledge of the puzzle in front of them. Participants were then given a brief verbal description of the rules of the puzzle and given an opportunity to ask questions. Once they had confirmed their understanding of the puzzle, participants were informed that they had five minutes to complete the puzzle, and directed to note the analog clock to their right. All instructions given verbally were also listed on the sheet on which they completed the puzzle. All participants received the same puzzle. While participants were completing the puzzle, in both rooms, the door was closed with no view of other rooms or the outside world while I waited in the hallway outside the room. After five minutes were reached on a stopwatch, the puzzles were collected. Participants were then given a second sheet of paper to report the beauty of the room on a seven-point scale. After the beauty score sheets were collected, participants were debriefed on the purpose of the experiment and given an opportunity to ask questions. Participants were instructed to not share information regarding the objective of the experiment, but they were told they could report to peers that they had to “complete a logic puzzle”.</p> 
    <p>Each group had 16 participants. The beautiful room, with an average beauty score of 4.25, was demonstrated to be more beautiful to participants than the ugly room, with an average beauty score of 2.75 (p=0.000541). The ugly room had 9 participants (56.25%) correctly complete the puzzle, while the beautiful room had only 1 participant (6.25%). The ugly room was shown to have a significantly higher completion rate than the beautiful room (p=0.00228). Out of 15, the sample mean number of cells correctly filled in the ugly room was 11.3, and was 5.6 in the beautiful room. The ugly room was shown to have significantly higher mean cells correctly filled than the beautiful room (p=0.00243).</p> 
    <p>There were some possible confounding variables. For one, data was collected on different days and at somewhat different times. There was also an IB French test occurring in a nearby room during the latter portion of the collection for the beautiful room. Additionally, the evaluation of the beauty of the room may have been impacted by the test performance, not the other way around, since the beauty ranking occurred afterwards. This would not be a confounding variable for the relationship between rooms.</p> 
    <p>The initial hypothesis — if a student’s surroundings include elements of beauty, then they will perform better on an academic test — was not supported. In fact, the experiment provided convincing evidence that the inclusion of elements of beauty hinders test performance. </p>
