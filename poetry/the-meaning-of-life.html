    <p>I discovered The Meaning of Life last night.<br>
        Unfortunately, it’s not anything comprehensible.<br>
        It’s not exactly productive in any way, sorry.<br>
        It felt great though, you should have been there.
    </p><p>
        What do you do after you discover The Meaning of Life?<br>
        I was so concerned about finding it that I forgot why I wanted to.<br>
        I guess that’s The Question of The Meaning of Life;<br>
        I always wondered about that idea from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
    </p><p>
        I was playing this weird game before:<br>
        Live my life just so that I can have that moment —<br>
        Pure satisfaction of understanding it all —<br>
        Timed right when I’m on my deathbed.
    </p><p>
        You can’t set your expectations so low that you reach them early. <br>
        You don’t get to hit that satisfaction until right before your escape plan.<br>
        You reach it, then leave before the awkward silence.<br>
        It’s perfect.
    </p><p>
        But I fucked up last night.<br> 
        I found it too early.<br>
        Now most people would be faced with an unanswerable question:<br>
        What do you do after you discover The Meaning of Life, the pinnacle of everything?
    </p><p>
        But the best thing is The Meaning of Life helped me realize <br>
        The peaks and valleys don’t really matter.<br>
        The rush of wind, the sinking of your stomach when you fly over the bumps —<br>
        That’s what’s really fun.
    </p>
