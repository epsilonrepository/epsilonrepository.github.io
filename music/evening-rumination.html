    <p>I’ve been crafting this EP for three years now. To give you an idea of the timeline: the first remnant of this project is a voice memo featuring my original ideas for Take a Seat on January 4, 2020 — though before that, I worked on songs that would be rejected. The EP was such a long time coming in part because it was a one-person production: I wrote, composed, recorded, produced, and released this project all alone.</p>
    <p>Evening Rumination tells a story of the worst period of my life, when I battled with depression, complicated love, an identity crisis, and emotions only expressible through art. Following the busy days of student living, the evenings I spent alone brought the calm that sparks the most potent experiences. Creating music was my outlet — one that would later give me a purpose that allowed me to escape this period. You’ll hear my worst thoughts as you travel through this reflection of my journey of recovery.</p>
    <p>Like all pieces of art, Evening Rumination is a distortion of reality, manipulated through melodrama and convenience. This is why I am releasing it not under my own name, but under an alias: Plain Henley. However, the EP is not one-dimensional; in fact, I’m proud of how it details certain nuances of my experience (and hopefully others’ experiences) in a way I haven’t seen anywhere else.</p>
    <p>I’ve moved beyond Evening Rumination, but it will also always remain a part of me.</p>
    <p>I’m excited to share this part of me with all of you — on Friday, November 19.</p>
