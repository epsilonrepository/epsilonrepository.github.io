    <p>I am not a man.<br>
        A man wouldn’t hear<br>
        “Stay on the pavement, girls!”<br>
        From his third grade lunch aide <br>
        After he stomped on the snow<br>
        With his friends, who were girls.           
    </p> 
    <p>I am not a man.<br>
        A man wouldn't have to insist<br>
        He’s not dating his best friend<br>
        To every kid in the grade who asks.<br>
        There is nothing between them,<br>
        Even though he’s a boy and she’s a girl.
    </p>        
    <p>I am not a man.<br>
        A man wouldn’t have to force a chuckle<br>
        When his friend admits on the ferris wheel<br>
        She actually had been crushing on him back then.<br>
        Well, it’s been two years<br>
        And it doesn’t really matter anymore.        
        </p>
    <p>I am not a man. <br>
        A man wouldn’t internalize the lunch table teasing.<br>
        He wouldn’t have to step his tormentor aside <br>
        To remind him that he doesn’t like <br>
        Being called the “gay best friend”<br>
        Because he isn’t gay and they aren’t friends.        
    </p>
    <p>I am not a man. <br>
        A man wouldn’t feel a pit in his heart<br>
        When his leg brushes another man’s.<br>
        A man wouldn’t be too scared<br>
        To ask their crush to pizza or something,<br>
        And their crush definitely wouldn’t be another man.
    </p>
    <p>I am not a man.<br>
        A man wouldn’t cry,<br>
        Even after catching word that he was<br>
        Marked a “liberal faggot” in the courtyard<br>
        And everyone laughed.<br>
        Men aren’t faggots.
    </p>
    <p>I am not a man,<br>
        But I am not a woman.<br>
        I am nothing but <br>
        A person<br>
        Who is supposed to wear the skin of a man<br>
        But forgets to get dressed.
