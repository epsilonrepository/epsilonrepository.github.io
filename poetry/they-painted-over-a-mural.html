    <p>They painted over a mural.</p>
    <p>Sure, it was bad<br>
    In the way that a kindergarten drawing is bad<br>
    The artist's heart is free from the weights of expectations<br>
    And what a remarkable thing to stay weightless for so long</p>

    <p>Our expectations are filthy, putrid worms<br>
    Engulfing us from our scalps to our backs<br>
    They whisper in our ear, telling us we need them<br>
    You wouldn't want to be bad, would you?</p>

    <p>The grass was actually alive, the skies were bluer than blue<br>
    And an otherwise ordinary castle was ordained by a scarlet dragon<br>
    Certainly an archetype, a cliche<br>
    Because cynicism need not enter the young artist's heart</p>

    <p>A heart is not fit for a school.</p>

    <p>The wall will be painted over in white<br>
    Neither pure nor bright<br>
    An off-white already stained<br>
    By the grime from grazing students' hands</p>

    <p>Perhaps the wall will be repainted<br>
    A new story can be told<br>
    But that is only a white lie I tell myself<br>
    They didn't repaint the last mural</p>

    <p>It will be an empty canvas<br>
    Longing to be filled with an expression of a soul<br>
    But destined to remain blank<br>
    To remind us that we are trapped in a facility</p>

    <p>That our hearts are not free.</p>
