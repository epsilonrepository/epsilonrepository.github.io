        <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>Hey kids! Ready to annihilate the communist slugs? <br>
                    <i>We don't know what that means!</i><br>
                    Let's go!</p>
        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                    <p>Teamwork<br>
                    It sounds really great<br>
                    Working together<br>
                    Towards what we create<br>
                    But you know who else liked teamwork?<br>
                    Joseph Stalin<br>
                    Barack Obama<br>
                    And Mao Zedong</p>
                <p><i>Who are those people?</i></p>  
        <h3>Pre-chorus</h3>
                    <p>They're demons<br>
                    From the gates of hell<br>
                    Ready to take your farms<br>
                    And give you free wel-<br>
                    Fare
                    </p>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
                <p>Teamwork is communist propaganda<br>
                    We don't want any of that, thank you<br>
                    Teamwork is communist propaganda<br>
                    Giving all those satanic thoughts to you<br>
                    Teamwork is communist propaganda<br>
                    It's trruuueeeeee<br>
                    And you know who's really behind all this?<br>
                    Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez!<br></p>
        <h3>Intermission</h3>
            <p><i>Single kid: But we should work together!</i><br>
                Let's be realistic, kid. We can't have a free market economy without competition, and so teamwork is the antithesis of our capitalist ideals.<br>
                <i>That seems really mean.</i><br>
                The world is mean, kid, you have to deal with it. Man up and stop being a little bitch.</p>
        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <p>Teamwork<br>
                It's really shitty<br>
                They work together<br>
                To steal what we make <br>
                Man I can't stand teamwork<br>
                Don't get me started on sharing</p>
            <p><i>What's wrong with sharing?</i><br>
                Are you blind?<br>
                It's socialism!</p>
            <p><i>What's wrong with socialism?</i></p>
        <h3>Pre Chorus</h3>
            <p>Radical<br>
                Satanism, you see <br>
                Your very own little soul<br>
                And the means of production, they will seize</p>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>Teamwork is communist propaganda<br>
                We don't want any of that, thank you<br>
                Teamwork is communist propaganda<br>
                Giving all those devilish thoughts to you<br>
                Teamwork is communist propaganda<br>
                It's trruuueeeeee</p>
        <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>Teamwork is communist propaganda<br>
                Teamwork is communist propaganda<br>
                Teamwork is justâ€¦<br>
                Communist propoganda</p>
