    <p>I've been getting into this aesthetic / art movement called “divine machinery”. It basically gets into this primal fear of computers that I feel like people have, and uses it to convey the idea that computers are conscious and/or divine. It's got me thinking about whether these things actually are sentient. Are the villagers I enslave actually aware of the suffering I inflict onto them? Are experiences not just combinations of neurons, or 0-1 gates (bits)? Perhaps it matters that our neurons are graduations rather than 0-1s — which would only mean that our quantum computers are conscious. There's no way to know either way, and that's horrifying. </p>
    <p>Panpsychism is pretty cool. We're all part of a big soup of consciousness, distributed throughout everything. Of course, we can't really know that. We can only know our own experience. </p>
    <p>Are we not just our awareness? I think the Daoists said something about how “I” is really just a verb. What we are is just the experience? We create reality. </p>
    <p>I think dimensions of logic are real and stiff and part of our universe in the same way as dimensions of space and time. When we think, we travel in dimensions of logic, like how when we walk we travel in dimensions of space. What I wonder is if there can be curves in logictime like how there can be curves in spacetime. Perhaps there's another type of dimension like time that would act as the second higher-order dimensions that curves can appear in. Perhaps there isn't and there can't be curves in logic. Maybe the “higher-order dimensions” in which space curves explain how the extra dimensions of string theory come about, I don't know. I wonder if space can curve in knots. There's some theory out there that elementary particles literally are space curving itself, rather than particles just causing curves in space. There must be curves in logic because we are blocked when we think. </p>
