	<p><i>Cleaner of Your Dreams</i> is a 2017 Super Bowl commercial for the various products using the brand name Mr. Clean. The advertisement depicts Mr. Clean, the mascot of the brand, interrupting a &lsquo;regular&rsquo; woman's daily life by cleaning the tough stains in the house for her. When it is revealed that Mr. Clean is actually a figment of this woman's imagination and he is, presumably, her husband, the two make out while the text “You gotta love a man who cleans” appears on screen. This Mr. Clean commercial perpetuates gender norms by creating a male-female dichotomy that is the main focus of the advertisement and is centered around a woman's supposed desires to cook, clean, and make out with men. </p>
	<p>There are three notable traditional gender roles being utilized in this commercial. First, the commercial begins with the woman cooking in the kitchen. The kitchen is the room most associated with housewives and strict gender roles because women are expected by society to cook all of the meals for their families, opposed to this task being completed by the men or not being associated with gender at all. Second, apart from his dancing, the housewife becomes infatuated with Mr. Clean for his ability to, well, clean. This perpetuates the stereotype that one of a woman's main desires is a tidy house. Third, the commercial is centered around the woman's romantic affection for Mr. Clean and her husband. The only three interests that this woman shows is in cooking, cleaning, and men. But the last words of the commercial: “You gotta love a man who cleans”, reveal that it is expected that all women relate with this character, not just housewives by their own volition. This is specifically through the word “you” that refers to the intended audience, which is most likely, from the content of this advertisement, women. This expectation explicitly pushes these stereotypes onto all women, only solidifying the already misogynistic messaging in this advertisement.</p>
