<div class="bulk">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve felt a weird sense of panic ever since I&rsquo;ve stopped wanting to die. Like I want to make sure that my life is as documented as possible. The Epsilon Project is a big part of that. The blog is to conquer my perfectionism and just write. The repository is to make sure my old work doesn&rsquo;t go to rot.</p>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t help but think about what would happen if I unexpectedly died. Because I have no idea when I will die, none of us do. I could have a long life and die at 89; I could get hit by a car when I&rsquo;m 47; I could be kidnapped in two days; there could be a cure to mortality and I live for a hundred thousand years. I&rsquo;ve tried to leave letters behind in case of my untimely demise but I keep procrastinating on it.</p>
    <p>I think this is also a reaction to a realization of my unproductivity. I often think about what I&rsquo;ve made in the past five years. Hold up I can literally list it for you. Music: an EP of five songs, plus an electronic album. Writings: three awkward short videos plus an odd school newspaper opinion piece or two. And I think that&rsquo;s about it. Like I&rsquo;ve tried to think about it for like 10 minutes and I can&rsquo;t add much more.  Except the mountains of school work that I was forced to pump out. I seriously think that the work that students do should have some significance, either to them or to their community. Because this crap that I was forced to do in high school has not been looked at since my teachers skimmed over them to give me an A minus or B plus: not extraordinary but not bad either. Of course my standards are different from others.</p>
    <p>I was thinking about putting some of this school work onto here but I&rsquo;m not sure about the possible legal ramifications? Like would that be helping people cheat? I wouldn&rsquo;t give the prompts, I don&rsquo;t think. Some of this stuff is actually pretty good. I started with my poems, though that&rsquo;s a different story altogether since it wasn&rsquo;t really graded or prompted.</p>
    <p>Let me just clarify real quick that the stuff I write in poems and in song lyrics is not necessarily a reflection of what I feel or think. I make shit up half the time. It&rsquo;s either just more convenient or the made-up stuff just hits harder. It&rsquo;s mostly exaggerations rather than straight-up lies. Like in &ldquo;Take a Seat&rdquo;, the refrain &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry&rdquo; is not what was going through my head during that period. Actually I was kinda being a pain in the ass to my loved ones because I was not holding back with what I told them. I was at a really tough spot and I felt that it was the only option to rely on other people. That &ldquo;selfish&rdquo; decision saved my life. I feel an immense amount of gratitude towards those people that helped me. But &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry&rdquo; sounded more edgy.</p>
    <p>I feel this same panic with the songs I listen to. I have so much music that I&rsquo;ve put in my mega-playlist on Spotify and no one knows what I think about those songs. Like there are certain songs that have so many emotions tied up with them. I also have tried to make a playlist called &ldquo;The Vault&rdquo; with all my favorite songs, but as I&rsquo;ve added and removed songs over the past three or four years, it&rsquo;s only gotten harder. I&rsquo;ve realized that preference is not just quantitative, it&rsquo;s qualitative too. It&rsquo;s multidimensional or something. Or it&rsquo;s not even dimensional at all, it&rsquo;s infinite-dimensional. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there are definitely songs that I like more than others, but there are also songs where I can&rsquo;t decide whether I like them more or less than other songs.</p>
    <p>For example, I love the album SOUR by Olivia Rodrigo. I think it&rsquo;s one of the best debut projects I&rsquo;ve ever heard, it&rsquo;s a zero-skip album for me. But I couldn&rsquo;t pick a favorite song. I could tell you that my favorites are &ldquo;drivers license&rdquo;, &ldquo;deja vu&rdquo;, and &ldquo;favorite crime&rdquo;, but then I&rsquo;ll relisten to &ldquo;jealousy, jealousy&rdquo; or &ldquo;1 step forward, 3 steps back&rdquo; and I have to reconsider where I draw the favorites line. And to ask which is #1 among those, that&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
    <p>Or 30 by Adele. That album was so good, but it&rsquo;s definitely not a no-skip album. Once I hear that bitchass kid on &ldquo;My Little Love&rdquo; &mdash; skip. But that album sticks out in my memory and so I wanted to add a song from there to my favorites playlist, but for the life of me I can&rsquo;t pick one. For 21, that&rsquo;s easy: &ldquo;Somewhere Like You&rdquo;. 25: &ldquo;When We Were Young&rdquo;. 19: I actually don&rsquo;t know, there are a couple that I like. For &ldquo;30&rdquo;, I like all of them, apart from my skips.</p>
    <p>I have to remind myself that no one cares about me as much as me. I&rsquo;m not a narcissist or anything like that, I&rsquo;m just enjoying my life a whole lot more and I want to share that enjoyment. But I think about how much I care about other peoples&rsquo; lives and I definitely don&rsquo;t want to know all of the intricate details. I want to preserve details about my life for my descendants, but I don&rsquo;t give much of a shit about my ancestors. I don&rsquo;t know how much people listen to my music, but they don&rsquo;t think about me or analyze my music the same way they think about their favorite artists. I&rsquo;m not disappointed in the slightest &mdash; I mean it&rsquo;s actually a little bit of a relief that they don&rsquo;t do that because I can&rsquo;t imagine giving that much energy in return to everyone close to me.</p>
    <p>But I would die to have someone give an in-depth review of my music. I don&rsquo;t want it for the validation of a positive review (I actually don&rsquo;t think I would get a good review, like I don&rsquo;t think my music is bad but it&rsquo;s definitely not like 10/10 worthy or anything). I want the attention and analysis that they give to my work. The lack of such a review reminds me that all the attention that I give to my work will not be mirrored after I die. That&rsquo;s sort of a sad thought.</p>
    <p>I remember looking at my reflection in the mirror as a 3 or 4-year-old and thinking about why I was living, what I was meant to do. My conclusion was that I was placed on this Earth because I would either be super famous, like a famous singer, or be super smart, like Albert Einstein. I&rsquo;ve since realized that mundanity is actually ok too. But there&rsquo;s still a part of me that wants to do something significant before I die. I want to make something &mdash; some idea, some work, whatever &mdash; that will long outlive me. Again, it&rsquo;s a reaction to death.</p>
    <p>I wish I was dumb. I wish I could do nothing and not think about how I was wasting my life away. But I&rsquo;m at least smart enough to be absolutely miserable about the fact that I&rsquo;m gonna die and leave nothing to my name or to this world. I also think about solipsism and how I could be freaking out for nothing and nothing is real anyway and I should just enjoy myself in the moment. But I can&rsquo;t prevent myself from thinking about what I&rsquo;ll think on my deathbed &mdash; if I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have one &mdash; and what my life was.</p>
    <p>You know what this is also a reaction to? I was in the closet from 11 to 18. SEVEN YEARS. I can&rsquo;t help but think about how I wasted that time. I can hear someone saying that I didn&rsquo;t waste that time, that I needed that time. Or that the time I came out was the right time to come out by nature of me coming out then and not before &mdash; the result is the evidence itself. But I definitely procrastinated a little bit, and now I&rsquo;m 19 and have never loved someone who loves me back. I fucked it up and I will never get a redo.</p>
    <p>So I really don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m supposed to do. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be on my deathbed and realize that I don&rsquo;t give a shit what happens after I die and I wasted THAT time. Ughhhhhhhh</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a related conflict between what I feel I should do and what I want to do. Like I want to paint my bedroom walls a darker color but I know that it will make the room smaller and there&rsquo;s the possibility that I won&rsquo;t like it more than how much I don&rsquo;t like my room color now. And then I&rsquo;ll be stuck with it for who knows how long because I&rsquo;ll feel too guilty to start the whole process over again because I would be a spoiled ungrateful wasteful careless person. But I know if I don&rsquo;t do it I&rsquo;ll regret what could have been. At least in the hypothetical scenario I will know that I&rsquo;m stupid, but if I don&rsquo;t do it then I&rsquo;ll never know. So I decided to do it.</p>
    <p>Anyway it&rsquo;s late so I&rsquo;m done writing now. You know I would hate to die in my sleep, like that&rsquo;s the worst way to die. I&rsquo;m not gonna knock on wood because superstition is stupid and jinxing isn&rsquo;t real.</p>
