    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Have you learned about space?<br>
        <i>A little bit!</i><br>
        What's your favorite planet?<br>
        <i>Mars!</i><br>
        Of course, you're a sheep. <br>
        <i>What?</i><br>
        Well, did you know that Mars is gonna completely disappear?<br>
        <i>What do you mean?</i><br>
        I'll tell you!</p>
    <h3>Verse</h3>
        <p>Our Sun is very neat<br>
            Keeps us warm and lets us eat<br>
            Illuminates the sky <br>
            But soon it will blow up and die</p>
        <p>The Sun is very exciting<br>
            Maybe for its own good<br>
            Because when it runs out of energy<br>
            It will make us one big pie</p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p>The Sun is kind of a bitch<br>
            I'm not gonna lie<br>
            The Sun is gonna consume the Earth <br>
            Leaving no person alive</p>
    <h3>Intermission</h3>
        <p><i>Why would the sun eat us? That's not very nice.</i></p>
        <p>I'm not smart enough for this. Let's google it! Okay, future of earth, solar evolution yadayda… okay here! Red giant stage! “Most of Earth's atmosphere will be lost to space and its surface will consist of a lava ocean”- ooh fun - “It is likely to expand to swallow both Mercury and Venus”- and the best part- “the Earth will probably be engulfed by the Sun”!</p>        
    <h3>Bridge</h3>
        <p>Lava oceans<br>
            Let's start toastin'<br>
            Atmosphere decayin'<br>
            Let's start prayin'</p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p>The Sun is kind of a bitch<br>
            I'm not gonna lie<br>
            The Sun is gonna consume the Earth <br>
            Leaving no person alive</p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p><i>I'm scared! I don't want to die!</i><br>
            Don't worry, it will only happen in about 5 billion years.<br>
            <i>That sounds like a long time! I'll be super duper old then!</i><br>
            Oh no, you won't, you'll be long gone by then. Sorry to break it to you, your life won't end that spectacularly.</p>
