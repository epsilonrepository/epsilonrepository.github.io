    <p>
        I see the cool air <br>
        Blowing through the stone spires,<br>
        The same spires our grandfathers, <br>
        and our great grandfathers, <br>
        and our great great grandfathers, <br>
        Looked up to,<br>
        To wish for a better life on the foundation of others.<br>
        The bay that stabs the city has remained pristine, <br>
        Its aqua gleam illuminating the damp riverside roads<br>
        And its scent traveling to the fenced yards of the suburbs.<br>
        Pavement is picked up by precipitous peaks,<br>
        Sliding cars, lifting houses.<br>
        I see the city as it is,<br>
        Molded by old riches;<br>
        I see the shimmer, the gleam, <br>
        The beauty of the city of gold. <br>
    </p>
