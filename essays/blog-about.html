        <h2>What My Blog Will Be About</h2>

        <p>If you think this blog is going to be the best blog in the history of the universe, you're wrong. In fact, I just learned that blogs still existed a few days ago when I started making this website. So, I'm not an expert in making blogs. But I will be posting here every so often.</p>
        <p>It will mostly be either ideas for videos that didn't make the cut, or ideas I will be making into videos soon. I don't expect anyone to check on this regularly, except maybe Ottis Plays or Turtwig Gaming. But I'm not even sure about them. </p>
        <p>The main reason why I have a blog on here is because this website needs to be more than just my newest three videos and a way to contact me. I want to have a second page on my website, and even if no one looks at it, it should be there just for looks. </p>
        <p>Making a blog would also be a great (and actually fun) way of creating scripts for my videos. Some of my videos will likely just be reading off the blog, so that way I can have two videos a week like I used to have (before I broke my wrist). </p>
        <p>That's all I have for right now. So if you think this blog is going to be the best blog in the history of the universe, you're wrong. It's just going to be slightly worse than mediocre. </p>

        <h2>Generation Alpha</h2>
        <h5>June 21, 2017</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="bulk"> <div class="essay">
        <p>In my previous article, I briefly discussed Generation Alpha, which was featured in Buzzfeed's video. I didn't even think about this, so I decided to dive deeper. I discovered Generation Alpha gets it's name from the first Greek letter, mostly because we ran out of letters in the English alphabet.</p>
        <p>Individuals in Generation Alpha will be born from 2010 to 2025. When I was researching, I realized that if you followed the 18 year segments, they would be born from 2020 to 2035. This is a problem, because it is generally accepted that Generation Alpha is from 2010 to 2025. </p>
        <p>Because of this unwanted overlap, I developed a new system. Generation X would be born from 1965 to 1980, Millennials would be born from 1980 to 1995, and the Homeland Generation would be born from 1995 to 2010. Then we can have Generation Alpha be born from 2010 to 2025, but keep lengths of the generations (mostly) consistent.</p>
        <p>Generation Alpha could also be called Generation Glass, according to generational researcher Mark McCrindle. He says they will be the most educated, most technology supplied, and wealthiest generation ever. Their oldest may be only seven, but we know a lot about what they will be.</p>
