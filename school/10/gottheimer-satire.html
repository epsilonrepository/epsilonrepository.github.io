    <p style="text-indent:0;">WASHINGTON — Notorious for his fierce centrist stances and compromise making, Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair and Democratic Representative for New Jersey's 5th District Josh Gottheimer released a statement Saturday morning warning of the dangers of “radical” corruption and anti-corruption. </p>
    <p>“Yes, we must not let Congress succumb to the dangers of bribery and crooked backroom deals,” wrote Gottheimer. “However, we must also resist extremist anti-corruption measures that tear our nation apart. A moderate amount of corruption is what I have advocated for and will continue to advocate for.”</p>
    <p>The Problem Solvers Caucus was formed in January 2017, the same month Gottheimer assumed his role as representative. It is a group in the House of Representatives composed of equal numbers of centrists from both major political parties. Like the caucus of which he was a founding member, Gottheimer has boasted of his bipartisan deals continuously, making Saturday's statement less surprising for those who have followed his career.</p>
    <p>After the statement received moderate amounts of backlash from both ends of the political spectrum, fellow co-chair Tom Reed defended Gottheimer. “This is what the Problem Solvers Caucus is all about: creating unique solutions that most people can just barely tolerate,” Reed tweeted Saturday evening. “You may not like our policy ideas, but at least you won't hate them as much as the other extreme.” </p>
    <p>Gottheimer's comments come during his first progressive primary challenge from Glen Rock resident Arati Kreibich. However, many are concerned that a progressive Democrat won't be able to capture independent voters in a district which has been described as “purple.” Despite this, the district is currently labeled a safe Democratic seat for the 2020 elections. Ridgewood grocery store cashier Joe Jonas remarked: “I guess I would prefer [Kreibich] on paper, but our representative right now is fighting for the same end goals as she is—like less corruption! So why risk it, you know?”</p>
    <p>Susan Miller, a Paramus resident, also stood with Gottheimer, but for different reasons. “I don't really follow politics, it's too messy!” Miller admitted. “But I think Josh what's-his-name has a point here. It goes without saying that the answer to our problems must be between both extremes; everything in moderation. Anyways, I don't see what's the big deal about corruption. People have the right to buy off our government if they want to. It's a free country!”</p>
    <p>The youth of New Jersey's 5th District have been especially upset with Gottheimer during his three years in the House. Kreibich's youth outreach director, Jen Brown, voiced her opposition to his comments. “This is absolutely ridiculous!” said Brown. “This is just another example of how incrementalism blocks real action from making its way through Congress. It is time for young people to push for real change, and that begins with removing the most vocal centrist in the House: Josh Gottheimer.” When asked for how the Kreibich campaign planned to bring out young voters on Election Day, Brown declined to comment. </p>
    <p>Progressives weren't the only group to criticize Gottheimer's statement. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is a pro-Israel lobbying group that Gottheimer has had strong ties to since entering office. “We unfortunately cannot stand by Josh Gottheimer's statement on limiting lobbyists' right to continue giving money to members of Congress,” AIPAC wrote. “Although we don't contribute directly to candidates, we will continue to support Blackstone Group's right to give $66,900 to Gottheimer's campaign. We support Comcast's right to give $56,000 to Gottheimer's campaign. We support NorPAC, another pro-Israel group, and their right to give $35,615 to Josh Gottheimer's campaign.” AIPAC ended the statement by endorsing Gottheimer in his primary race.</p>
    <p>Joining AIPAC in denouncing Gottheimer, a lobbyist in a menacing dark cloak agreed to comment on the statement anonymously to us, with multiple bodyguards surrounding him from all angles. “He has the right spirit,” the masked man stated, with a soulless demeanor and a choking presence. “However, my colleagues and I are insulted by his use of the word ‘crooked' to describe our work. We are extremely hospitable. You have nothing to fear from us. Perhaps we need to demonstrate our kindness by sending him a couple thousand dollars for his campaign.”</p>
    <p>As of Monday, Gottheimer has continued to ignore the criticism. Despite his 12% approval rating, he is expected to win the 2020 election by a similar margin as the 2018 election, where he won with over 56% of the vote.</p>
