<div class="bulk">
    <p>In the face of an inexperienced student body, rapidly changing school norms, and persistent threats to and breaches of the human rights of the student, a series of Fundamental Student Rights must be declared.</p>
    <p>Recognizing that no document can be fully comprehensive of all rights, this declaration is intended to capture many of the rights available to students. In practice, the rights listed herein may need to be balanced; it may not be possible to construct a policy that protects all rights listed herein to each of their fullest extents. In such cases, student rights should be compromised only for a more ideal execution of the totality of rights listed as well as the principles they represent. School policy should always act in the interest of the student and their well-being, not just in schooling, but in all domains.</p>
    <p>The clauses set forth are applicable to all students: present and future. The order of clauses is arbitrary and is not intended to be representative of significance or precedence. As unforeseen circumstances arise, students are encouraged to amend this declaration, though any revisions should be identified as such and not attributed to the &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;.</p>
    <p>As of publication, this document has not been recognized or mandated by the &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; administration. However, we implore that rights listed herein not be infringed upon by the school nor by who it employs, which requires exercising rights herein to not be punishable.</p>
    <p>Every student of the &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; has the right to:</p>
