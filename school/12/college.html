    <p>I just spent five hours straight editing Wikipedia. Yet again this summer, I completely lost track of time&mdash;I look at my clock, it's 3 AM. My brother and parents are asleep, the usual hum of the streets is absent, and the only light illuminating my room is the harsh white glow of my laptop screen. It's in moments like these, in the late hours of the night rummaging through rabbit holes of pure information, where I find the greatest enjoyment. But whenever I explain the intricacies of my contributions to my friends and family, I always see a hint of puzzlement on their faces. I can understand why: out of all the ways a teenager could spend their precious free time, why would I waste it on additional academic tasks for no pay or credit?</p>
    <p>I like to think that Wikipedia, for all its faults, is humanity's greatest collective work. Turn on the news or strike a conversation with anyone about the state of the world and you will always hear one word: &ldquo;division.&rdquo; And yet, due to the good faith of ordinary people around the world uniting to work towards the common cause of accessible information, encyclopedia articles on practically every subject imaginable are now available online for free. They're far from perfect though, and with the ability to easily fix glaring problems, from outrageous falsehoods to small grammatical errors, of course I would do my part to help.</p>
    <p>I've personally never been particularly concerned with being credited. My satisfaction is derived from knowing that I made tangible contributions to something meaningful. I've always loved and valued learning, but my one issue with some of my high school classes has been that my towers of work plummet into the abyss, condensing until the only palpable thing I have to show for it is a single letter grade. Conversely, when I finish work on a Wikipedia page, I immediately see that I made a difference, however big or small. Out of my 1,400 edits, my proudest is on the Stonewall Riots article. I didn't write paragraphs of prose, I didn't correct falsehoods&mdash;I included an image. Searching through the Wikimedia Commons (a sister project of Wikipedia dedicated to collecting public domain images), I came across the only known photograph taken during the first night of the riots. As many words as there are about the Stonewall riots, nothing can ever replace the experience of seeing an image of the actual event. By including this photograph as the first image, I provided that experience to thousands of article viewers, many of which may have been learning about this landmark event in queer history for the first time. As a gay man myself who didn't learn about Stonewall in school, or any queer history for that matter, helping educate other people on this subject is even more meaningful to me.</p>
    <p>Editing Wikipedia also allows me to explore my favorite subjects in-depth. Though I've improved hundreds of articles, the most in-depth project I've undertaken so far was creating a brand-new article: &ldquo;Political views of Generation Z.&rdquo; Evident by my plans to study political science, I'm obviously attracted to that subject, but I'm also endlessly engrossed by the concept of how our society categorizes social groups, more specifically age groups. While I embarked on this endeavor to contribute to the library of public knowledge, I also got the opportunity to research worldwide generational voting patterns, socioeconomic values, and political movements.</p>
    <p>I refresh the page and a notification appears on the top of my screen: &ldquo;Your recent edit has been reverted by another user.&rdquo; Though I may be physically alone in my room, I am frequently reminded that I have integrated myself into an online community of editors, which has long preceded me and will continue beyond me. Well, I guess I need to debate my fellow editor. Staying up till 4 AM couldn't hurt, right?</p>
