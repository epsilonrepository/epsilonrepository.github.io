    <p>My father often told me tales:</p>
    <p>Hoards of ships sail into islands,<br>
        Vast distances from his children.<br>
        Many names they pass to their sons,<br>
        But there's one that remains. There's one.</p>        
    <p>One man was a poor gold miner,<br>
        Who breathed not very long ago,<br>
        Who caught his lucky star, higher<br>
        Than he could ever hope to go.</p>    
    <p>He took this star and molded it,<br>
        Played with it, held on without fail.<br>
        With energy, it glowed and lit<br>
        His hopes, his dreams, uncovered trail.</p>
    <p>From this trail all his sons walked well<br>
        While staying absolutely still, <br>
        Until the trail took a sharp fold<br>
        Away from the glow of the gold.</p>
    <p>A single ship sailed to our home,<br>
        Vast distances from his old land.<br>
        One name he passed on to his own.<br>
        One from a tale of a miner.</p>
