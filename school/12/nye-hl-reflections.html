    <center><h2>Reflection on HL Essay options</h2></center>
<div class="bulk"><div class="essay">
    <p>For my HL essay submission, I had five essays prepared that were usable. As I was less familiar with the IB HL essay format in junior year, I was less inclined to use my first three essays. The first essay was about the video essays <i>Pronouns</i> and <i>The Aesthetic</i> by Natalie Wynn, and I felt that this essay was very unfocused due to the lengths of the texts in question. The second essay was about the opinion article by Joseph Epstein &ldquo;Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D.&rdquo;, which I felt took too much of an editorial approach that was inappropriate for this kind of submission. The third essay was about the TV show <i>Riverdale</i> on the CW, and this faced a similar problem to my first essay, which was that I was attempting to analyze a five-season TV show.</p>
    <p> This left me with the two essays I did this year: the first was on the novel <i>Jane Eyre</i> by Charlotte Bront&euml;, and the second was on the poems &ldquo;Valentine for Ernest Mann&rdquo;, &ldquo;Trying to Name What Doesn't Change&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Kindness&rdquo; by Naomi Shihab Nye. I was stuck between these two essays for a while, and I didn't have any preference that would help me decide like you suggested. I ended up deciding to submit the Nye essay.</p>
    <p>To be completely honest, when writing the essay about Nye's poetry, I did not intend for it to be the essay I would submit to IB. I mainly chose the Nye essay because it presented my ideas more clearly than the Jane Eyre essay, which would frankly benefit from the addition of a couple hundred (or couple thousand) words to properly communicate the ideas I wanted to communicate. I also thought that the organization of the essay (1 paragraph for introduction, 2 paragraphs for each poem, 1 paragraph for conclusion) was easier to follow. And rereading these papers, the Nye essay seemed to fit better into its theme (transformation) than the Jane Eyre essay (communication), even though I had struggles with both while writing. </p>

    <center><h2>Post-reflection on HL Essay submission</h2></center>
<div class="bulk"><div class="essay">
    <i>Write a reflection of at least 300 words where you review your process and reflect in detail about the draft you have submitted for your IB Language & Literature grade and how well you think it applies to the expectations of the HL essay.</i>
    <p>For my IB HL essay, I submitted an essay about conceptual transformations in the poetry of Naomi Shihab Nye, specifically the poems “Valentine for Ernest Mann”, “Trying to Name What Doesn’t Change”, and “Kindness”. I honestly did not imagine this would be the draft I would end up submitting. This was in part because I already had a draft I was happy with—my essay about the representation of the worker’s struggle in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Although the HL essay draft about Nye’s poetry dealt with more abstract ideas, I feel that I was able to organize my thoughts effectively. </p>
    <p>After selecting my essay about Nye to be the essay I would submit, my main challenge was articulating my line of inquiry. Because this essay was broad in scope, I had to refine my idea for my line of inquiry (only in the introduction, I didn’t need to adapt my wording throughout the entire essay). I had to introduce some central ideas of my essay in the introduction (transformations through time in one person and transformations through different people) in order to contextualize what I meant by “conceptual transformations”. </p>
    <p>My one worry is that I didn’t apply my analysis well enough to the form of a poem, rather focusing more on the ideas she presents. However, throughout my editing process prior to submission, I couldn’t identify any other ways to include these elements in the essay. Instead, I attempted to emphasize the times I do mention the elements of a poem (like when I identify 3 realizations, one for each stanza). </p>
    <p>I feel that the content of this essay is up to par with the expectations of an IB HL essay. I imagine that the organization is the primary strength of the essay, while connections to the textual type is the primary weakness of the essay.</p>
