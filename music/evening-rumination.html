                <p>
                    Take a seat
                    <br>I have something to say
                    <br>I'm wondering
                    <br>If these problems go away
                </p><p>
                    It seems to come back every year
                    <br>I work through the sweat and the tears
                    <br>I don't want to see you act like me
                    <br>So don't worry
                </p><p>
                    Why can't you see
                    <br>I haven't talked yet
                    <br>I don't wanna be
                    <br>Melodramatic
                </p><p>
                    Fading away my dreams of bliss
                    <br>I can't recall times of happiness
                    <br>I don't want to see you act like me
                    <br>So don't worry
                </p><p>
                    Have I drank today?
                    <br>I don't think I've slept
                    <br>But what still remains
                    <br>Is the memories that I've kept
                </p><p>
                    All of my friends and family
                    <br>You held me against the gravity
                    <br>But just let me go, I'm falling free
                    <br>Don't worry
                </p><p>
                    Don't worry
                    <br>Don't worry
                    <br>Don't worry
                    <br>Don't worry
                    <br>Don't worry
                    <br>Don't worry
                    <br>Don't worry
                </p><p>
                    Don't worry (Don't worry)
                    <br>Don't worry (Don't worry)
                    <br>Don't worry (Don't worry)
                    <br>Don't worry
                    <br>So don't worry

                    Even after dark
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>An ocean apart

                    Ten months it has been
                    <br>And all through
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>And underneath your skin
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>In my view
                    <br>I saw you
                </p><p>
                    You're not where I belong
                    <br>A film without a star
                    <br>That's life, just my eyes
                    <br>Even though for so long
                    <br>It's all been from afar
                    <br>It's hard to say goodbye
                </p><p>
                    In everyone I met
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>I could never forget
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>I saw you
                    <br>(I saw you)
                </p><p>
                    But I can't take it
                    <br>It's hard to grab what I can't feel
                    <br>It makes you wonder what's real and true
                    <br>True in you
                </p><p>
                    You're not where I belong
                    <br>A film without a star
                    <br>That's life, just my eyes
                    <br>Even though for so long
                    <br>It's all been from afar
                    <br>It's hard to say

        <h2>Blurb / announcement</h2>
    </center>
<div class="bulk">
    <p>I've been crafting this EP for three years now. To give you an idea of the timeline: the first remnant of this project is a voice memo featuring my original ideas for Take a Seat on January 4, 2020 — though before that, I worked on songs that would be rejected. The EP was such a long time coming in part because it was a one-person production: I wrote, composed, recorded, produced, and released this project all alone.</p>
    <p>Evening Rumination tells a story of the worst period of my life, when I battled with depression, complicated love, an identity crisis, and emotions only expressible through art. Following the busy days of student living, the evenings I spent alone brought the calm that sparks the most potent experiences. Creating music was my outlet — one that would later give me a purpose that allowed me to escape this period. You'll hear my worst thoughts as you travel through this reflection of my journey of recovery.</p>
    <p>Like all pieces of art, Evening Rumination is a distortion of reality, manipulated through melodrama and convenience. This is why I am releasing it not under my own name, but under an alias: Plain Henley. However, the EP is not one-dimensional; in fact, I'm proud of how it details certain nuances of my experience (and hopefully others' experiences) in a way I haven't seen anywhere else.</p>
    <p>I've moved beyond Evening Rumination, but it will also always remain a part of me.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to share this part of me with all of you — on Friday, November 19.</p>
