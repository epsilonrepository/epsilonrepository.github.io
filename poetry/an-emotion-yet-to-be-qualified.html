<div class="bulk">
    <p>There’s an emotion yet to be qualified when staying up late at night.
        </p><p> A sensation where you aren’t tired but aren’t alert or aroused. 
        </p><p> You’re focused but aware of yourself. 
        </p><p> You have a weight on yourself, an inertia that doesn’t allow you to feel much of anything. 
        </p><p> It drags your cheeks down so you’re locked in a permanent neutrality.
        </p><p> I don’t know if it’s the remnants of my depression that my medication hasn’t been able to strip away or if this a universal phenomenon; I certainly felt this way before.
        </p><p> But it isn’t sadness, it isn’t depression, at least I don’t believe so. 
        </p><p> Whatever it is feels amazing. 
        </p><p> It’s a peace, a calm, security, but not a satisfaction or lack thereof. 
        </p><p> A key part is solitude: a guarantee that the day is over, nothing is preventing you from doing anything, besides the duty to go to sleep, though that is a time in your control. 
        </p><p> No one is awake, and if they are, they will not talk to you until the next day, absent some unconceivable emergency. 
        </p><p>  At the same time you feel an emptiness — perhaps that’s my procrastination to sleep combined with my urge to achieve the ultimate state of emotional completion — you feel that you need to do one more thing that you enjoy to indulge in. 
        </p><p> That’s another thing, you can only enter this emotion through indulgence but not excitement — monotonous pseudo-enjoyment is the best path. 
        </p><p> I would label this state neutralness but it is simultaneously so intense that it feels wrong to dismiss this as a lack of emotion. 
        </p><p> It’s in a category of its own. 
        </p><p> Perhaps it’s my overthinking, my introspection, my tragic combination of calmness and intensity, all of this that brings me to this state. 
        </p><p> Perhaps I’m the only one to ever feel this way.
        </p><p> I lay in an affect yet to be described by words, a territory uncharted or undocumented, and it makes me feel uniquely distant from the regular world of labels and the known. 
        </p><p> As I write more and more, I lose my focus, my daze, and I escape this emotion. 
        </p><p> I grow tired, I yawn, and I’m gone. 
    </p>
