    <center><h2>i fucking hate blogs</h2></center>
    <center><h4>March 30, 2023</h4></center>
    <p>While searching through the dozens of website providers, I realized that they all suck. Why am I starting a blog? I have no time anyway. But alas, this will continue, at least for two or three more days.</p>
    <p><b>Note from the future:</b> There was a funny joke here about how I couldn't put in line breaks on the website provider Dorik, which previously held this blog. But then I made my own website so it doesn't make sense. <a href="https://bapple.dorik.io/b2">Take a look at the post here because it is really haha</a></p>
    <p>I am so excited for when I put something actually serious and good up on here because the tonal changes will be hilarious. Like on May 17, you'll see a post titled "cheese balls in my asshole", and then on May 18, you'll see "A Neo-Marxian Foucultian Post-Structuralist Perspective on Dialectical Materialism in East West Afghanistan - Part II".</p>
    <p>Obviously, you can't write a political text if you're constantly defining terms like "left-wing" or "statute". But how about "post-structuralism"? At some point, these terms get so confusing that people don't agree about what they're talking about. Even terms like "liberal" mean different things depending on the context or speaker. </p>
    <p>I think the problem is that a lot of the good ideas have already been taken. Take gravity, for example — I could have thought of that. It's not a particularly advanced concept. But Issac Newton just happened to exist during a time of stupidity — he could capitalize on possessing a brain. Later, people actually had to think. General relativity is one difficult concept to come up with. Einstein was a smart fellow. But we're starting to run out of shit to do. So people are just writing in the most convoluted way to hide the fact that they aren't actually saying anything — or that they are saying something someone else has already said before them. </p>
    <p><b>Side tangent:</b> I hate people using the title "Sir". Like Sir Issac Newton. Piss off. </p>
    <p>Anyway, I'm still trying to figure out what the fuck post-structuralism is. My hypothesis is that structuralism was just too good that the academics in that field (whatever field it is) needed something new to do.</p>
    <p>I'm gonna try to actually come up with something new. And when I tell everyone, I'm not going to smart it up. That isn't to say I won't use formal language; I actually like formal language. But I'll make sure I explain from the beginning — for the dummies.</p>
