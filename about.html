    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3 style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0;">Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I'm not quite sure myself, but I'll tell you what I do know. My name's Edward and I use he/him/his pronouns. I enjoy a lot of stuff; to name a few things: politics, writing, music, philosophy, math. Exploring this website will probably help you learn more about me.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0;">What is the Epsilon Project?</h3>
        <p>The Epsilon Project is my general-purpose repository. I'll put anything substantial that I create here, whether it's good or bad or somewhere in-between. The repository is supposed to be all-encompassing but also organized. I also keep my blog here, which I view as the combination of a public diary, prose poetry, and philosophical buds.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0;">What can I steal from here?</h3>
        <p>Unless I explicitly mark something otherwise, everything on here is my intellectual property. I store things here as a resource for curiosity and inspiration, not for theft.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0;">What can I share from here?</h3>
        <p>Currently, I would prefer that you don't share this project. It's important to know that the Epsilon Repository is also a morbid vault to preserve my legacy. So once I die, feel free to share this far and wide; but until then, keep it under wraps!</p>
