    <p>The 2013 adaptation of <i>The Great Gatsby</i> does not hold up to the novel's intentions when introducing Jay Gatsby's parties by forming displays of Gatsby's immense wealth opposed to displays that reveal his desire to elevate his social status. </p>
    <p>In the novel, displays of opulence are of course grand, but also proper. Nick almost immediately mentions the buffet tables covered with exquisite delicacies. A full orchestra plays music all night long, providing a backdrop for the rich men with their younger dates to dance in the garden. The “hilarity” that is described by Nick are, to modern day readers, incredibly innocuous acts: “a celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung jazz and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky” (Fitzgerald 51). Jordan even wants to leave at the first course of dinner, admitting that the party is “too polite for me” (Fitzgerald 49). </p>
    <p>The party in the novel is also notably quiet, especially at the beginning, because many business deals are taking place between these important figures that Gatsby attracts and social climbers who want to make easy money. Nick elaborates, “I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were all selling something” (Fitzgerald 46). So of course this party is an opportunity for those already at the top of the social hierarchy to let loose, but it is also an opportunity for others who want to climb the hierarchy to make some quick money and connections. Evidently, the East Egg dominates Gatsby's parties. </p>
    <p>The portrayals of the parties by Lehrman, the director of the 2013 Great Gatsby film adaptation, differs quite a bit to the novel. Lehrman focused on making the party, especially during the first scene at Gatsby's estate, a grand spectacle in order to show off Gatsby's affluence. One obvious example is the colossal amount of confetti and fireworks that paints the background of the party. The vibrant colors and heavy amounts of contrast are signatures of this film's appearance, but is prevalent in this scene specifically in the bright blue water, and the pink and orange of the dancers' dresses. The part of the soundtrack that plays is a hip-hop jazz fusion that is certainly not meant to be realistic of the 1920's, but, along with many of the other elements in this scene, allows a modern day audience to relate with such an extravagant party in a completely different time.</p>
    <p>However, this choice comes at a price: the narrative. The shimmer of the jewels on the various headpieces, dresses, rings, and accessories of the guests flaunt their wealth in a way only those from the West Egg would do. The eccentric appearances and wild behavior of the guests in the movie demonstrates an abundance of wealth, yet a lack of class that only new wealth processes. Yet, as we know, Gatsby is attempting to surround himself with rich and powerful people, specifically from the East Egg, to elevate his own status to impress Daisy. He is willing to let some of the West Egg in (it is an open party, of course) but his goal is to have the event dominated by the power of the old wealth, to become one of them. But the film doesn't show this in the party scene. Here too, the film fails to show Gatsby's desperation to become part of the old wealth by showing him, in the movie, as confident and in control versus stilted and not quite about to join in during the novel. This is demonstrated by one critical observation by Nick: “the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him apart from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased” (Fitzgerald 54). </p>
    <p>This conflict is the reason why so many, including myself, believe the film falls flat: the film is too obsessed with spectacle to focus on the character motivations that are intended to drive the story. </p>
