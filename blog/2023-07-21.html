<div class="bulk">
    <p> About three to four weeks ago, I got this weird irritation on my gums on the top left side above my molars. Granted, I may have forgotten to brush my teeth for like two days, but this is what happens when you have brain funnies. So this has happened before, like a bunch during my depressive periods when I don&rsquo;t take care of myself, but usually a week of painful brushing will bring it back to normal. But this time&#8230; it didn&rsquo;t!!!!</p>
    <p> So for the first time in recent memory, I went to the dentist not for a routine cleaning. And because I&rsquo;m now going to the adult dentist instead of the pediatric dentist (as evidenced by the fact that I refer to it as a &ldquo;pediatric dentist&rdquo; and not a &ldquo;kid dentist&rdquo;), I don&rsquo;t even get a toy from the treasure chest. >:( I think adult dentists should have treasure chests too, but with adult toys. Ok wait that sounds bad thats not what I meant</p>
    <p> Anyways I went to the dentist and they asked if I had been stressed recently, and I said no since I haven&rsquo;t been in school. But as I&rsquo;ve thought about it, I have been really stressed. My summer internship consists of a lot of cold calling regular people and asking them if they want to get involved with a political campaign. I do believe in what I&rsquo;m doing, so I&rsquo;ll push through the social anxiety, the anxiety is still there. It&rsquo;s diminished a bit since I first started, obviously.    And you know what grinds my gears grrrrr During our meetings, none of the other interns talk!!!! Which is really fucking annoying because that means I have to talk ALL THE TIME. Like it gets really awkward also after I speak because no one else talks and I stick out like a sore thumb. So that sucks.</p>
    <p> What I&rsquo;ve learned from all this is that you can&rsquo;t grind your way through stress and anxiety. Who would have known it?</p>
    <p> My music is also reaching a dead end right now, because I&rsquo;m bad at production. I have a concept but making that an actual reality is different. &ldquo;Actual reality&rdquo; is redundant. But writing lyrics that don&rsquo;t sound cheesy is really difficult. I think my writing has evolved over the past two-three years, and I want my songs to reflect that. Of course all of this doesn&rsquo;t matter if you can&rsquo;t get started in the first place!!!</p>
    <p> I&rsquo;ve also started writing a script for a video to release during the summer. It&rsquo;s the first independent piece of structured writing I&rsquo;ve written in a WHILE. I&rsquo;m now in the revision part of the process, and there are so many moving parts to the concepts that I&rsquo;m talking about that it&rsquo;s difficult to structure the script. Also some of my arguments are stronger than others, and I need to make sure that I&rsquo;m being clear that I&rsquo;m not undermining our cause. It&rsquo;s hard to talk about this without revealing what it is, but I want to keep it a surprise!</p>
    <p> Managing everything has been weirdly stressful in a way that it isn&rsquo;t during the school year. Once you enroll in classes and join clubs, almost all of your time is scheduled. But not during summer&mdash; you actually have to think about stuff. This isn&rsquo;t to say this isn&rsquo;t present during the school year&mdash;I should have been doing a lot of stuff that I just didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
    <p> All of this is incredibly frustrating. But it&rsquo;s just part of the growing pains of entering adulthood, I guess.</p>
